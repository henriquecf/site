title: "From Autocomplete to Autonomy: How Claude Code Changed the Way I Build Software"

  I haven't written a line of code in weeks, and I've shipped more features in the last month than in any comparable period of my career.

  I went from GitHub Copilot's autocomplete to Cursor's agent mode to Claude Code, and each step changed not just my speed but how I think about the work itself.

  The real shift? I stopped writing code and started writing specifications. I describe the business context, the technical constraints, how it integrates with existing systems. Claude Code handles the implementation. I review, steer, and iterate.

  Some of what I shipped this way at BSPK (a clienteling platform for luxury retail):
  - Natural language client search powered by LLM-to-Elasticsearch translation
  - A multi-agent AI assistant with swarm architecture
  - Ruby 4.0 and Rails 8.1 framework upgrades
  - A full behavioral analytics pipeline from scratch

  92% of my recent commits are co-authored with Claude. The commits are bigger, better documented, and more thoroughly tested.

  This doesn't replace understanding though. If I didn't deeply know our Elasticsearch setup, Rails conventions, and business domain, I couldn't direct any of this effectively. AI amplifies what you already know.

  The developer's job is moving up the abstraction ladder, just like it did from assembly to C to Ruby. Senior engineers who understand *why* code should be structured a certain way? That knowledge just became much more leveraged.

  Not because I stopped working. I've shipped more features in the last month than in any comparable period of my career.

  I went from autocomplete → agent mode → AI-directed development. Here's what actually changed:
