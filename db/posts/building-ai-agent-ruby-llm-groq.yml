title: "Building an AI Chat Agent with RubyLLM and Groq"

  My last post was about how Claude Code changed the way I build software. This one shows a concrete example: I built an AI chat agent for my personal site in a single session.

  The agent lives at hencf.org/chat. Visitors can ask about my experience, skills, and blog posts. It has tools to search content dynamically, streams responses in real-time via Turbo Streams, and costs essentially nothing to run.

  The stack is deliberately simple:
  - RubyLLM for the AI layer (Rails-native, built-in persistence and tool framework)
  - Groq for inference (fast, free tier, OpenAI-compatible API)
  - SQLite + Solid Queue for everything else (no Redis, no Postgres, no vector DB)

  What we didn't build matters as much as what we did. No RAG pipeline, no vector database, no fine-tuning. The entire site's content fits in one system prompt. Three tool classes handle deeper lookups. That's it.

  The architecture is upgrade-ready: switching from Groq to GPT-4o or Claude is a one-line config change. The code doesn't care which model answers.

  The whole site — including the agent — is open source: github.com/henriquecf/site

  I built an AI chat agent for my site in a single Claude Code session.

  RubyLLM + Groq + Turbo Streams. No RAG, no vector DB, no React. Just Rails.

  It searches blog posts, knows my experience, and streams responses in real-time. Cost: ~$0.

  Here's how it works 👇
  ---
  The key decisions:

  • RubyLLM — Rails-native AI. Built-in persistence, tool framework, streaming.
  • Groq — sub-second inference, free tier, OpenAI-compatible API.
  • No RAG — site content fits in one prompt. Tools handle deeper lookups.

  Switching to GPT-4o or Claude? One line change. Architecture stays the same.

  It's all open source: https://hencf.org/blog/building-ai-agent-ruby-llm-groq
